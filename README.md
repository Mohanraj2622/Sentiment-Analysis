# Sentiment Analysis Project

## Project Description

This project involves analyzing the sentiment of textual data using various machine learning techniques. The notebook provided explores the dataset, preprocesses the data, and applies different models to classify the sentiment. Visualizations are also included to help understand the data and the results.

## Notebook Contents

The notebook is divided into several sections:

1. **Introduction**
   - Overview of the project and objectives.
2. **Data Loading and Exploration**
   - Loading the dataset.
   - Initial data exploration and visualization.
3. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Cleaning and preparing the data for modeling.
   - Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, etc.
4. **Model Training**
   - Training different machine learning models.
   - Evaluating model performance.
5. **Results and Visualization**
   - Visualizing the results of the models.
   - Comparing performance metrics.

## Setup Instructions

To run the notebook, you will need to have the following dependencies installed:

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Seaborn
- Matplotlib

You can install the required packages using pip:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn seaborn matplotlib
```

## Usage

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
